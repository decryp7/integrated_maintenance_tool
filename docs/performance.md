# Performance record (bundle sizes and startup)

Rule 35: every release records the initial chunk size, and the budgets in `app/angular.json` are measured size plus 10%.
Measured with `cd app && npx ng build` (production) and a headless Chromium load of `dist/app/browser` with the mock
backend (browser build; the desktop app loads no mocks).

## 2026-10-23, baseline before the Angular phase-1 migration (main at 67a51214)

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Initial chunks (what `ng build` budgets) | 171.76 kB raw (styles 164.42 kB, `main` 6.80 kB, polyfills 0.5 kB); 15.77 kB transfer |
| Why so small | `main.ts` loads translations, then lazily imports `bootstrap`; the real startup cost is the lazy `bootstrap` chunk graph |
| `bootstrap` chunk (static closure, 122 chunks) | 1.52 MB raw |
| Largest single chunks | notices-generated 766 kB, a shared vendor chunk 678 kB, messages-pseudo-json 563 kB (only for the pseudo locale), bootstrap 466 kB |
| Browser startup (mock backend, to `networkidle`, 5 runs) | about 1.1 s, 170 requests, 3.69 MB raw (2.5 MB of it is the closure of the mock-backends chunk, browser only) |
| Total chunks | 3 initial + 285 lazy |

Budgets set from this: `initial` warn 190 kB / error 210 kB (measured + 10%, was 1.5 MB / 3 MB); `anyScript` warn 845 kB
(largest chunk + 10%) / error 1 MB.

## 2026-10-23, after Angular phase 1 (lazy Settings screen and diagnostics collector)

| Measure | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Initial chunks (budgeted) | 171.76 kB | 171.76 kB (unchanged: `main` only loads translations, then `bootstrap`) |
| Startup JS in the `bootstrap` static closure, raw | 2.08 MB (123 files, incl. 563 kB pseudo-locale messages loaded only for pseudo) | 1.87 MB (115 files) |
| Same, gzip | 602 kB | 544 kB |
| Browser startup bytes (mock backend, networkidle) | 3.69 MB, 170 requests, about 1.1 s | 3.52 MB, 169 requests, about 1.1 s |

The Settings screen (with its Storage, Parsers, Keyboard and other tabs) and the diagnostics collector dialog were
imported statically by the services that open them; their `open()` now loads them on first use. Views registered through
`component: () => import(...)` were already lazy. Largest remaining startup weight (stats-json, bytes in output):
dockview-core 479 kB, the mock backends 248 kB (browser only), Angular core 158 kB, echarts about 200 kB (pulled in by
chart cards and the Home view), the share/report, tools and AI folder-setup modules (statically imported by commands).
Next candidates: lazy dialog services for share/report, the format wizard and folder setup, and an `@defer` around echarts
consumers. How to measure: `npx ng build --stats-json`, then group `dist/app/browser-stats.json` outputs by input.
